Mehtods to implement javaScript

1. In your browser
2. In the browser console
3. In the run time by using node.javaScript
4. In the html file by using script tag

JavaScript has 8 Datatypes

1. String
2. Number

In javaScript we using "prompt" for taking input from user. prompt is always take input as string and it is only working in browser
In javaScript prompt ask us to something and alert tell us something

let a = "45"
a = Number.parseInt(a); // This is convert string into a Number it is also known as type casting.

Template Literals :- Template literals are enclosed by backtick (`) characters instead of double or single quotes.Along with having normal strings,
template literals can also contain other parts called placeholders, which are embedded expressions delimited by a dollar sign and curly braces: ${expression}.

String Interpolation :- When variable is directly inserted into template literals that is called string Interpolation.

String is immutable in javaScript.
In javaScript array is a type of Object.
In javaScript join() Mehtods return a type of String.
In javaScript pop() Mehtods remove the last element from the array. and return the poped element.
In javaScript push() Mehtods add element in end of the array. and return the new array length.
In javaScript shift() Mehtods remove first element from array and return that element.
In javaScript unshift() Mehtods add element in the begging in the array. and return new array length.
In JavaScript concat() Mehtods is used to concatenates the arrays. but original array does not change.
In javaScript sort() Mehtods sort the array alphabetically.
In javaScript reverse() Mehtods is reverse the array. this is change the original array.
In javaScript splice(i, j ,x , y, z) Mehtods is add , delete element in the array. i denote the position of the array , j denote how many element you hav to deletein
              the array, x , y , z denote the element which you have add to.
